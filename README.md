# PerfectRecipes

A web application that uses React, MongoDB, Express, Google Firebase, and the Spoontacular API to allow users to save, customize, and search for recipes.

I was inspired to make this application by the common experience of finding a recipe online that looks good, only to have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page each time I view it just to see the ingredients and instructions.
